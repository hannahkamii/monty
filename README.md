This project was done by Valentine Nyongesa and Hannah Kaminja

0. This question handles the push and pall opcodes whre the push opcodes inserts elements into the stack and pall opcodes prints elements of the stack

1. This tas handles the pint opcode which  prints the value at the top of the stack

2. This question handles the pop opcode which removes the top element of the stack

3. This task handles the swap opcode which swaps the top two elements of the stack.

4. This task handles the add opcode which adds the top two elements of the stack

5. This task implements the nop opcode that doesnt do anything

6. This task implements the sub opcode that subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack

7. This task handles the div opcode which divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack

8. This task implements the mul opcode which  multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.

9. This task implements the mod opcode that find the modulus of numbers

10. This task implements the comment opcodes When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (donâ€™t do anything).
